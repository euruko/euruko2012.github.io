When a company like [ClubJudge](http://www.clubjudge.com), the world's official hallmark for quality of nightlife venues is throwing a party, you just know it's going to be great.

<br/>
This time it's no exception: the party will be held at the exquisite [Club Home](http://www.clubhome.nl/)!

Since 2008, Club Home's unique atmosphere has attracted thousands eager to soak in the laid back environment, right in the center of the city. Located a few hundred meters away from the conference venue, Club Home has 3 rooms available for mellowing out (Main room, Bedroom and the Living room).

Soundscapes will be delivered by the dynamic duo of [Sander May & Tom Noah](http://soundcloud.com/sandermaytomnoah), promoters of KLIKK Music which organizes indoor and outdoor events as well as hosts of a monthly radio show.

Doors open at 21:30 and trust us: you don't want to miss this one!
