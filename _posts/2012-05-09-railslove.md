Lovers united: Railslove sponsoring EuRuKo!


Railslove sure lives up to its name - a household name on the german RoR scene, Railslove has organized two editions of _Railscamp_ in their home country so far and their employees are also co-organizing this year's [Railsgirls_cgn](https://twitter.com/railsgirls_cgn) in Cologne.

Their [portfolio](http://railslove.com/work/) includes [9flats](http://www.9flats.com), [Payango](http://www.payango.com), [Tipplr](http://www.tipplr.com), [Salesking](http://www.salesking.com) and more.

Community presence is important for Railslove too, and they have a long standing tradition of mentoring and support (they were founded in 2008). And get this: they're looking to add talent to their 16-strong [team](http://railslove.com/team/), so do check them out.

Railslove's website is [here](http://www.railslove.com) and you can follow them on Twitter [too](https://twitter.com/railslove).
