Basho was founded in 2008 by a group of former Akamai employees and executives, and it's fast becoming one of the biggest names in the NoSQL scene. They're the brains behind [Riak](http://basho.com/products/riak-overview/), an open-source and highly scalable distributed database, with a rather compelling feature set. They have also recently ventured into cloud storage with [RiakCS](http://basho.com/products/riakcs/), a Riak based, S3 compatible cloud storage technology that allows companies to offer public or private cloud storage solutions.
