We're excited to welcome _Lunar Logic Polska_ as one of our Gold sponsors for this year's EuRuKo.

Founded in 2004, LLP's quality, flexibility and affordability quickly made it one of the top Ruby on Rails players in Poland. Not your standard offsourcing partner, the professional team they have on deck is experienced in Agile practices and best practices upholding.

They're the master minds behind [Kanbanery](http://http://kanbanery.com/) (an elegant Kanban board), [Qwerly](http://www.qwerly.com/home) (a social utility for people discovery) and [LegalRelay](http://www.legalrelay.com/) (a legal software reviews service) among many other projects - check out their portfolio [here](http://www.lunarlogicpolska.com/our-work).
