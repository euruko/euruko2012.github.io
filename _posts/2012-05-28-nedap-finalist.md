Nedap is unlike most companies. Their focus is widespread (ranging from agriculture to security and healthcare) but the attitude is the same across the board: to create intelligent products, and to do it efficiently.

Established in 1929, and listed on the stock exchange since 1947, Nedap has a global presence. Being a relatively small company of 650 employees, they adhere to a horizontal structure so the quality of your work speaks higher than your rank. They are also always on the lookout for new talent. If you think you have what it takes to own your ideas and bring them to fruition in a quick paced workplace, check out their [job openings](http://www.nedap.com/nedap-labs/careers-at-nedap/).

They will be sponsoring the all-important coffee available at the venue!

Finalist provides enterprise-grade content management, data visualization and integration solutions for big players across all industries.
