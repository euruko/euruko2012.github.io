      <p>Geoffrey Grosenbach has been designing and developing web applications since 1997. You might recognize his soothing voice from the Peepcode screencasts, of which he is the founder. Or maybe you also know he is nuts about road cycling, a hobby and so much more!</p>
      <p>Residing in Seattle, WA, the birthplace of grunge music, maybe try sharing your favorite coffee tip, or even mention the 'amazing' Starbucks ;)</p>

He has also created the RubySpec project to improve the standards for high quality, consistent, and compliant Ruby implementations, and is focused on improving Ruby and thereby making the lives of developers even better.</p>

      <p>Charles has been programming most of his life, as a Java developer for the past decade and as a JRuby developer for over six years. He co-leads the <a href="http://jruby.org/">JRuby</a> project, an effort to bring the beauty of Ruby and the power of the JVM together. Charles believes in open source and open standards and hopes his efforts on JRuby and other languages will ensure the JVM remains the preferred open-source managed runtime for many years to come.</p>
      <p>Did you know Charles has an awesome beard? Maybe you might both bond over beard grooming advice!</p>

      <p>
        Bruno is an old school coder who enjoys complex problems and simple solutions.
        He works at Cubox in Uruguay helping startups make their dreams come true. His love for
        new languages is stronger than ever, with Ruby, Python and Javascript under his belt he
        is now starting to fall in love with Go!
      </p>
      <p>
        Bruno has worked in the telecoms field for far too long, but he has learnt many awesome
        and tragic things, from different async protocols to how to become a cronic workaholic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secretly Bruno is a clown in disguise who likes to dress up, maybe you might see him
        at EuRuKo, or maybe you won't, or at least you won't know it :)

      <p>Sean is a pianist, software engineer, composer, philosopher, web designer, conductor, singer, teacher, and technology advocate. So I guess the question really is, 'what isn't Sean Cribbs?'</p>
      <p>As a Software Engineer for Basho Technologies, Sean spends his time hacking in Ruby, Erlang, and JavaScript (and occasionally Python) on the client interfaces to Riak, Basho's distributed, fault-tolerant database.</p>
      <p>Random fact : Sean used to be a Choir director for 3 years, and we hear from a reputable source that he loves it when you sing Silent Night to him in falsetto!</p>

      <footer><a href="http://hone.heroku.com/">Website</a> - <a href="https://twitter.com/hone02">Twitter</a> - <a href="https://github.com/hone">Github</a></footer>
      <p>Terence works at Heroku, maintaining the Ruby stack and some OSS projects such as Bundler and Resque. On his free time, he helps the Rails Girls movement. When he's not going to an awesome Heroku or Ruby event, he lives in Austin, TX, the taco capital of America.</p>
      <p>This talk tells the shortcomings of Bundler 1.0 and how Bundler 1.1 aims to increase developer happiness. This includes the story of working with the gemcutter team to add an API to <a href="http://rubygems.org/">rubygems.org</a> and building support to make bundle install significantly faster in 1.1. Finally, the talk will conclude with
  plans for the future in Bundler 1.2 and beyond to further make application development easier.</p>
      <p>People will walk away with a better understanding of how bundler works and features to help ease app development pain while
  using it.</p>

      <p>Eloy, who was born and raised in this year’s host city ‘beautiful Amsterdam’, has long been working at the intersection of open-source Ruby and Objective-C/Cocoa. This combination has lead to his current job at <a href="http://www.fngtps.com/">Fingertips</a> where he works on Web, iPhone, iPad and Mac OS X apps.</p>
      <p>His open-source time is spent on <a href="http://cocoapods.org/">CocoaPods</a>, <a href="http://www.macruby.org/">MacRuby</a>, and many related projects.</p>
      <p>If, at some point, you might think "who’s making that music?", then it might be Eloy, who’s constantly beatboxing unconsciously. If you are up for it we can organize a beatbox showdown on stage!</p>

      <p>Vicent Martí has a name which is difficult to pronounce. Despite his main occupation as bananologist, he spends his spare time working full time at GitHub, where he builds tools for the people who build the Internet.</p>
      <p>His dreams invaded by shadowy figures: pink ponies and raw pointers, he loves sharing his love for what he believes is beautiful technology. An European citizen (Spain, according to his passport), Vicent enjoys drums and yellow things and the sweet sweet smell of civilization.</p>
      <p>We are slightly worried about his love for bananas, he even requested he have some available 'backstage', we didn't even know we had a 'backstage'!</p>

      <p>Did someone say German engineering? Let me tell you about German engineering: It is boring! It is thorough, it is efficient, and it just works.</p>
      <p>Martin has been doing this stuff for more than 20 years now. He tamed the very first home computers, made assembly code fit into HBLANK, and ran a BSD-based home server before Linux had even surfaced. Currently he is developing highly scalable backends for the Berlin-based social gaming company Wooga.</p>

      <p>When we think 'Mitchell Hashimoto' the first thing that comes to mind for us is <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, the awesome tool for creating and distributing virtualized development environments. In short, it makes <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> awesome to use!</p>
      <p>Mitchell spends his days as an operations engineer for a start-up company in San Francisco. He is Passionate (with a capital P) about all things open source, and boy does he show this passion with awesome contributions to the community.</p>
      <p>We often hear crazy reasons why people got into programming, welllllll, did you know that Mitchell only wanted to learn how to code so he could cheat neopets!!! Without neopets, he may have never found computers!!!</p>
      <p>Do you have a neopet? Maybe bring one to EuRuKo and get some special 'hints' from Mitchell ;)</p>
